# ASP.NET2
This project was written in C# using ASP.NET. It was my second ASP.NET project in a week. However this time I used a blank template so I started from scratch. 
What is included in this project is CSS, HTML, and a connection to a MySQL database using a select * statement. 
I tried to play around with the design of this page as much as I could, I also played around with hiding certain visibilities when certain buttons are clicked to get some practice.
I deleted the password to the database connection part of the project to protect my own privacy.
